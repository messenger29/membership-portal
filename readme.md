# Membership Portal - Laravel Project

## Background
This is a project that I am volunteering my time and expertise for a boating sport organization to replace a legacy membership management system. Core functionality that must be kept includes participant registration and managing waivers; managing not only teams that are governed by the organization but also local non-organization/out-of-area teams that participates in the events that the organization hosts; race registrations; and admin dashboard for various tasks.

I decided to go with the Laravel framework as the other organization volunteers only have a background in some PHP/HTML/CSS/JS. Laravel has a lot of documentation out there for anyone to follow and this is meant to be passed on to future volunteers to manage and also extend if needed. Also another opportunity for to learn another framework.
